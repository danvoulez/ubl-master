## 🚀 **THE ULTIMATE VISION**

By 2035, when someone says **"I need to..."**:
- Send money → They create a `ubl/payment.send` chip
- Book travel → They create a `ubl/travel.book` chip
- Learn something → They create a `ubl/education.request` chip
- Create art → They create a `ubl/art.generate` chip
- Solve climate change → They create a `ubl/planet.heal` chip

**Every human intention becomes a chip. Every chip execution is auditable. Every decision is deterministic. Every outcome builds toward transcendence.**
